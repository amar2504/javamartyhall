How do we implement the concurrent programing in Java Programs ?
We have to create a task list :
        Make a task list:
	ExecutorService taskList = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(poolSize);
 Add the task list to the execute service:
        taskList.execute(someRunnable);
        
We can implement this the same we did for the Applet drawing in previous example:
        1) We can create our own separate class and add that to execute,
        2) We can implement the methods of runnable class in the executor itseld and pass "this" to execute
        3) We can make named or anonymous inner classes.
        4) We can use Lamda as well.
